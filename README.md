### Hi there, I'm A3nktr0 ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer student at Zone01. I Love coding, solving problems, and learning new things.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...

A portfolio with a wide range of different projects in order to progress and expand my capacity for action.

## I'm currently learning ðŸ“š

- I'm learning **C, C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Assembly, Lisp, Ruby, PHP, and SQL** to expand my knowledge of different programming paradigms, syntaxes, and data manipulation.
- I'm exploring various web development frameworks and libraries such as **React, Vue, Node, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Django** to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
- I'm also interested in learning more about **security and sys admin skills** to improve the performance, reliability, and security of my projects.
- Some of the resources that I'm using or creating to learn new things are:
  - [nand2tetris](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md): A course that teaches how to build a modern computer system from first principles.
  - [Project Euler](https://github.com/sar5430/crackmes.one): A series of challenging mathematical and programming problems that require creative thinking and optimization.
  - [OZINT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sVyQkOWz-1k): A platform that provides open source intelligence tools and resources for cyber security professionals.
