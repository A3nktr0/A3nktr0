### Hi there, I'm A3nktr0 ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer student at Zone01. I Love coding, solving problems, and learning new things.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on

- A portfolio with a wide range of different projects in order to progress and expand my capacity for action.

## ðŸ“š I'm currently learning 

- I'm learning **C, C++, C#, Python, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Assembly, Lisp, Ruby, PHP, and SQL** to expand my knowledge of different programming paradigms, syntaxes, and data manipulation.
- I'm exploring various web development frameworks and libraries such as **React, Vue, Node, Ruby on Rails, Laravel, and Django** to create dynamic and interactive web applications.
- I'm also interested in learning more about **security and sys admin skills** to improve the performance, reliability, and security of my projects.
- Iâ€™m fascinated by robotics and artificial intelligence and Iâ€™m using ROS (Robot Operating System) to develop and simulate robotic applications.
  
- Some of the resources that I'm using or creating to learn new things are:
  - [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/): A course that teaches how to build a modern computer system from first principles.
  - [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/): A series of challenging mathematical and programming problems that require creative thinking and optimization.
  - [OZINT](https://ozint.eu/): A platform that provides open source intelligence tools and resources for cyber security professionals.
  - [rootme](https://www.root-me.org/): A website that offers realistic hacking challenges and training materials for ethical hackers.
  - [hackthebox](https://www.hackthebox.com/): An online platform that allows users to test their penetration testing skills and exchange ideas with other members of the community.
  - [crackmes.one](https://crackmes.one/): A website that hosts a large collection of crackmes, which are small programs that challenge reverse engineering skills.
  - [hackaday](https://hackaday.io) A platform for hardware enthusiasts and innovators.
