## ðŸ“š Technical Proficiency
I enjoy working across multiple domains, combining problem-solving with adaptability and continuous learning.

### ðŸ”¹ Programming & Software Development
Balancing low-level efficiency (C, C++, Rust) with high-level flexibility (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript), I choose the right tools for each challengeâ€”whether optimizing system performance, developing scalable applications, or refining security implementations.

### ðŸ”¹ Full-Stack Development & Architecture
Secure and scalable application design is a priority. I work with React, Vue, and Node.js, ensuring robust API security, database management, and performance optimization while maintaining development efficiency.

### ðŸ”¹ Cybersecurity & Penetration Testing
Security isn't just about toolsâ€”itâ€™s about strategy and execution. I focus on vulnerability research, exploit development, and network security auditing, refining approaches through both manual testing and automation. Developing custom security scripts helps me uncover insights beyond standard penetration testing methodologies.

### ðŸ”¹ System & Network Security
I approach infrastructure with a security-first mindset, strengthening systems through firewall configurations, authentication mechanisms, and proactive threat mitigation to ensure stability and resilience.

### ðŸ”¹ Cyber Threat Intelligence & Security Automation
Cybersecurity requires a proactive intelligence-driven approach. I integrate threat intelligence into workflows, analyzing attack patterns, automating detection, and refining defensive strategies. This strengthens situational awareness, streamlines detection, and reinforces resilience against evolving threats.

### ðŸ”¹ DevOps & Infrastructure
I integrate streamlined workflows, automation, and deployment strategies to improve efficiency:
- Implementing CI/CD pipelines for optimized software delivery.
- Utilizing containerization and orchestration to enhance scalability.
- Managing cloud infrastructure with automated provisioning and security enforcement.
- Monitoring system performance to ensure reliability and uptime.

### ðŸ”¹ AI & Robotics
Beyond cybersecurity and development, I explore robotics and automation, integrating ROS (Robot Operating System) for intelligent control systems and real-time sensor fusion. My AI work extends into automation, including machine learning-driven security monitoring, predictive analytics, and adaptive response systems to enhance digital and physical security implementations.
